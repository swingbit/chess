# chess
A simple chess engine. 
Because it's fun and because I needed an excuse to get accustomed to Rust

## Status
- Move generation: mostly done (missing special rules such as castling, promotion, en passant)
- Check validity of human moves: mostly done (missing special rules such as castling, promotion, en passant)
- UI: to be done. 
  Options:
  - make a simple console UI
  - make the engine [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)-compatible and use an available GUI)
- Search algorithm: to be done (min/max, with horizon effect)
- Game oprtimizations: to be done (alpha/beta pruning, move ordering)
- Code optimizations: to be done (more efficient board representations, multi-threading)
